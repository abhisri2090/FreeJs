# ✨ Contributing to Free JS ✨

❤️ I would love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- 🐞 Reporting a bug
- 💬 Discussing the current state of the code
- 🔧 Submitting a fix
- 💡 Proposing new features

## 🔄 I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. 🍴 Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. ✅ If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. 📝 If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. ✔️ Ensure the test suite passes.
5. ✏️ Make sure your code lints.
6. ⬆️ Issue that pull request!

## 📜 Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.

## 🐞 Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/abhisri2090/FreeJs/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/abhisri2090/FreeJs/issues/new); it's that easy!

## 📝 Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## 🎨 Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## 📜 License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
