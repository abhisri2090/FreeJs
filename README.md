# FreeJs
An free source code repo for JS / React / React Native, aims to provide piece of useful code that you can directly use / customise for your use case.
Problem: I generally face problems where I need a library but not all the part of that lib or i need a customised version of lib (just for my use case). So I got FreeJs.
__Note :__
* Every module will have a elaborated Readme with module description, problem / issue addressed and code walk-through / methodology.
* Modules will have proper comments on code with an example.
* Modules may have an __Add-On__ folder, which would have some additional help full feature that can be added along with base module.
