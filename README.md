# FreeJs ‚ö°Ô∏è

A free source code repo for JS / React / React Native, FreeJs aims to provide pieces of useful code that you can directly use or customize for your use case.

## The Problem üöÄ

Often, developers find themselves needing a library but not all parts of it, or requiring a customized version of a library tailored specifically to their use case. FreeJs was born to solve this problem.

**Note :** üìù

- Every module will have an elaborate Readme with the module description, problem/issue addressed, and a code walkthrough/methodology.
- Modules will have clear comments within the code along with an example to demonstrate its use.
- Modules may have an **Add-On** folder, which would contain additional helpful features that can be added along with the base module.

# FreeJs Modules üìÇ

1 - [useApiCall](https://github.com/abhisri2090/FreeJs/tree/main/useApiCall): A hook to format API calls life-cycle and separate API calls from the UI.
2 - [Modal](https://github.com/abhisri2090/FreeJs/tree/main/Modal): A synchronous way to handle modal (open modal onClick without state variable).
3 - [Mui Table](https://github.com/abhisri2090/FreeJs/tree/main/Table): A clean and better way to use Mui Table with column sorting, custom filters, search (other filters can also be added), and pagination. The table handles various states like loading, error, and no-data. It uses props to allow customization of the data displayed, column configuration, sorting, and filtering.
